# SocialiteJs::Source

JavaScript source code for socialite.js wrapped in a rubygems shell.  
socialite.js is a library to display social sharing buttons.  

check http://socialitejs.com/ and https://github.com/dbushell/Socialite  

This rubygem is a shell over the `socialite.js`  
Its version will be the same as socialite.js and was created to:  
1. make it easier to bundle socialite.js in Rails apps. one step over manually copy-pasting js files  
   can upgrade the gem to get a newer version of the js files.     
2. release management. version and specify a specific version of socialite.js in your Rails apps.  
3. other gems like `socialite_js` will integrate `socialite.js` in Ruby on Rails  
   but can use the `socialite_js-source` gem seperately, if you only want the js files  
   and want to integrate manually into your framework    

#### Why does the gem name have dashes ? 

The name of the gem is socialite_js-source. It contains a dashes because it sits under the namespace of socialite_js
so you will be requiring 'socialite_js/source' not 'socialite-source' in your ruby code

see http://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/#consistent-naming under the "Use dashes for extensions" section

## TODO
Seems like the socialite.js library does not follow any specific versioning

And btw hate the name of the gem.  

@gnufied said it best on the #ruby-lang irc channel 
the name `socialite_js-source` is `ugg` :-)

> dkannan: me too but the name socialite is taken  
> dkannan: how about socialite_js-source  
> gnufied: ugg  

Any other suggestions ? :-)
